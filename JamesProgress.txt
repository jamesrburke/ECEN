Lab 9/5/19
In the previous week I have looked into fixing a problem with our microcontroller that can't connect to the tamu wifi. 
This is due to the connection security being WPA2 Enterprise which my device doesn't have code to handle.
Corrections being looked into are asking IT about a hotspot as well as looking into other single board computers.
I have also started looking at the EEG sensor we have to develop code for which has been changed multiple times.

Lab 9/12/19
In the past week I have gotten with IT to get permission to connect the device to the IOT network.
I am currently providing IT with the devices' mac addresses and team member names to get permission.
I have also worked with Gabe to attempt to connect with the database.
